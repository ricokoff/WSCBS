Welcome to group 18 of Web Service and Cloud Based Systems 2020. We implemented a SOAP calculator and a REST URLshortener. Please take a look at the folders of the respective project to learn more about our implementation.

## Prerequisities ##

To be able to run our implementations, some basic packages and programs are needed. We used the following settings:

### JDK 14 ###
We used Java Development Kit 14 to develop and run our programs. This JDK can be downloaded at https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk14-downloads.html.
